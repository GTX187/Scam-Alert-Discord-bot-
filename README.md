# Scam-Alert-Discord-bot
Discord moderation bot that checks for links that are unsafe and carry potential risk. 

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project has been the chaos caused in Discord over the last few months. For context, as most of you would be aware, in recent times, Discord was floaded with hackers that were spamming scam nitro links using the account of the person that clicked on the link, into the servers they were in, along with their DMs. As a result, people had to either delete their account, or change their password etc, which was just sad to watch. Therefore, I was determined to help the community by this project!

## What does it do?
This bot once called in a server, scans every link that any member posts in a channel and checks whether it is safe to open. If, there is a potentially security risk, then the bot deletes all instants of that url and issues a warning via DM to the user that they have posted a forbidden link.

## How we built it?
This bot is built using the discord.js and Node.js frameworks with Visual Studio Code being the IDE. The bot was created and set up using the Discord deveoper portal.

## Challenges I faced and leanrings 
As this was my first time coding a Discord bot, I had lot's of issues with the set-up such as having a lower version of Node.js which didn't fulfill the requirement resulting in no output for quite sometime. I had issues with setting up a connection between the bot and server. I was also working for the first time with JavaScript, so it took me a while to get a hang of the syntax. Pretty much everyhting thing I did over the hackathon was completely new so I enjoyed and leanred a lot. Amazing experience!
